As a member of the USDA-ARS [Emerging Pests and Pathogens Research Unit](https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/ithaca-ny/robert-w-holley-center-for-agriculture-health/emerging-pests-and-pathogens-research/), I am studying model bacterial systems as well as emerging plant pathogens that are of concern to local and national stakeholders. For novel isolates, we are using inexpensive long-read and high-throughput short-read sequencing technologies to sequence and annotate whole-genome assemblies. Building upon genomic comparisons to model strains, I am using [RB-TnSeq](https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00306-15) to construct large barcoded transposon mutant libraries to characterize our standard "lab strains" as well as consequential field isolates.
