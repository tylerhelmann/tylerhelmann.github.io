I did my PhD research in the laboratory of Dr. Steven Lindow at UC Berkeley in the [Department of Plant and Microbial Biology](https://plantandmicrobiology.berkeley.edu). My work focused on *Pseudomonas syringae*, a model bacterial plant pathogen commonly found on leaf surfaces that is capable of moving into leaves to cause disease. 

To broadly understand host-colonization traits, I constructed an [RB-TnSeq](https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00306-15) transposon mutant library in *P. syringae* strain B728a, and used it to [compare fitness traits on the leaf surface and in the apoplast (leaf interior)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1908858116). I then expanded the plant host environment from common bean to lima bean and pepper, and showed that certain functional gene categories [contributed differentially to fitness across the tested plant species](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239998). 

I was particularly interested in exploring strategies that this ubiquitous species uses to tolerate the diverse antimicrobial chemicals found in the environment. Bacteria often produce multiple redundant toxin efflux transporters, and as a result, it can be difficult to identify specific roles of these proteins. Using RB-TnSeq in a *P. syringae* mutant lacking a major transporter (MexAB-OprM), I identified conditions where [alternative efflux pump genes contributed to survival](https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.02614-19).
